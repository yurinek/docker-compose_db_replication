    # In the docker-compose mode, docker tries to start all the container in detached mode by default. If there is no process running inside the container within certain duration, docker thinks the container has finished its work and exits it. If this is not a foreground but a background process, docker thinks the foreground process has finished and exits the container. Docker-compose does not support â€“t as a command line parameter but docker-compose.yml provides "tty: true".

# whats happening:
  # 1. intermidiate master container is created
  # 2. master image is created from intermidiate container
  # 3. intermidiate slave container is created
  # 4. slave image is created from intermidiate container  
  # 5. master container is created from image and keeps running with the help of tty: true
  # 6. slave  container is created from image and keeps running with the help of tty: true   
  # 7. replication script starts on slave container 
# these steps can run simultaniously, therefore its important to implement wait logic e.g. slave container should wait for master to be up and ready
